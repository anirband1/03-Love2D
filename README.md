# Games made in Love2D

These are my very first programs made - following a CS50 course - as an introduction to game development.

- Pong:        Introduction to Lua (first game ever!)
- Flappy Bird: Flappy bird, but the gap becomes smaller and smaller (introduction to concepts of game dev)
- Breakout:    Similar to Atari's breakout (introduction to procedural level generation)
- Adio:        A platformer where you avoid pits and dodge missiles (made as a farewell gift to a friend ðŸ‘‹ )
